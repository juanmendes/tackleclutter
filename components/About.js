            <h3>A little about me</h3>

            <p>Being a planner was a skill that shaped me to be who I am today and helped me see that I LOVE organizing. I was 18 years old and living abroad in the US. Not realizing what was really happening, I would help friends with projects in their homes. After doing makeovers in their closets, garages, basements, people would tell me that I had great organization skills and that I should do that for a living but I never really listened. Finally, 2 years ago I decided to pursue this career. The feeling of helping people to live a more clutter free life, and show them that they can enjoy their homes to its full potential, is the best reward.</p>

            <p>Everyone has some skills that just come natural to them. It could be teaching, writing, being well spoken, being creative or being organized. However, I believe that even if you were not born with a specific set of skills you can always learn how to improve yourself and become more confident in it. That happens with organizing. If you set your mind on living a clutter free life, and you are ready to do something about it, you can learn to be more organized. Trust me, anyone can learn to be more organized. I continuously learn ways on how to be more organized myself! </p>

            <p>I have been married to my wonderful husband, Juan, for 8 years now. We don’t have any kids yet but we do have 2 furry little ones, Bailey and Sofi.  After living in San Diego for 5 years, we moved to Boston to stay closer to Juan's family. In 2015, we bought a house in Stoneham, MA. We are still in the process of buying furniture and settling in. It’s so exciting! <a href="http://facebook.com/tackleclutter">Follow me on social media</a> and you will see many projects and changes we have been making to our new house as we make it our home.</p>

            <p>I've worked with many different clients and types of homes, big and small. One of my goals as a professional organizer is to show you that no matter what kind of house or space you have, you can get organized and live clutter free. I will help you address your space and create a customized organization plan that works for you. It’s important to be aware of the space you have, and how much you are trying to fit in it. Decluttering first is a must if you want to create an organized space.</p>

            <p>Thank you for stopping by and I hope to <NavLink to="/contact">hear from you soon</NavLink>.</p>
