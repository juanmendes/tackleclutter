            <h3>A little about me</h3>

            <p>I’ve always been organized from a very young age. I enjoyed organizing my dolls, my desk,
                my closet and making my room look nice. That’s where I spent most of my time studying and hanging
                out with my
                friends so I liked having my room presentable. It was important to me. I can clearly remember myself
                organizing
                my pink wardrobe closet (actually my whole room was PINK!). It had three tall doors, but I could
                only use two of
                them to keep my clothes and shoes, the other one my mom would keep our extra bed comforters.
                I would remove everything from my shelves and hangers and declutter by deciding what I would keep,
                pass along
                to my younger cousins or discard. I don’t remember my mom ever asking me to organize my room or
                closet. 
                I was always a step ahead of her (haha what a good daughter huh?!) I’ve always been a planner.
                I would get back from school and do all my homework or projects right away. I hated procrastination.
                It would make me anxious and nervous if I knew I had something undone for school. I had to get it
                done!

            <p>Everyone has some skills that just come natural to them. It could be teaching, writing, being well
                spoken,
                being creative or being organized. However, I believe that even if you were not born with a specific
                set of
                skills you can always learn how to improve yourself and become more confident on it.
                That happens with organizing. If you set your mind that you would like to live clutter free and you
                are ready
                to do something about it you can learn to be more organized. Trust me, anyone can learn to be more
                organized.
                I continuously learn ways on how to be more organized myself!</p>

            <p>Being a planner was a skill that shaped me to be who I am today and helped me see that I LOVE
                organizing.
                I was 18 years old and living abroad in the US. Not realizing what was really happening, I would
                just help
                the ones around me with projects in their homes. After doing makeovers in their closets, garages,
                basements,
                people would tell me that I had great organization skills and that I should do that for a living.
                But I never really listened. It wasn’t  until 2 years ago that I decided to pursue this career.
                Oh, and I’m so glad I did. The feeling of helping people to live a more clutter free life, and show
                them that
                they can enjoy their homes to its full potential, is the best reward.</p>
