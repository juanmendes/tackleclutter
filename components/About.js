            <h3>A little about me</h3>

            <p>I’ve always been organized from a very young age. I enjoyed organizing my dolls, my desk, my closet
                and
                making my room look nice. That’s where I spent most of my time studying and hanging out with my
                friends
                so I liked having my room presentable. It was important to me. I can clearly remember myself
                organizing
                my pink wardrobe closet (actually my whole room was PINK!). It had three tall doors but I could
                only
                use two of them to keep my clothes and shoes, the other one my mom would keep our extra bed
                comforters.
                I would remove everything from my shelves and hangers and declutter by deciding what I would keep,
                pass
                along to my younger cousins or discard. I don’t remember my mom ever asking me to organize my room
                or
                closet. I was always a step ahead of her (what a good daughter, huh?) I’ve always been a
                planner. I
                would get back from school and do all my homework or projects right away. I hated procrastination.
                It
                would make me anxious and nervous if I knew I had something unfinished for school. I had to get it
                done!</p>

            <p>Everyone has some skills that just come natural to them. It could be teaching, writing, being well
                spoken, being creative or being organized. However, I believe that even if you were not born with a
                specific set of skills you can always learn how to improve yourself and become more confident in it.
                That happens with organizing. If you set your mind on living a clutter free life, and you
                are
                ready to do something about it, you can learn to be more organized. Trust me, anyone can learn to be
                more
                organized. I continuously learn ways on how to be more organized myself!
                Being a planner was a skill that shaped me to be who I am today and helped me see that I LOVE
                organizing. I was 18 years old and living abroad in the US. Not realizing what was really happening,
                I
                would help friends with projects in their homes. After doing makeovers in their closets, garages,
                basements, people would tell me that I had great organization skills and that I should do that for a
                living but I never really listened. It wasn’t until 2 years ago that I decided to pursue this
                career.
                Oh, and I’m so glad I did. The feeling of helping people to live a more clutter free life, and show
                them
                that they can enjoy their homes to its full potential, is the best reward. </p>

            <p>I have been married to my wonderful husband, Juan, for 8 years now. We don’t have any kids yet but we do
                have
                2 furry little ones, Bailey and Sofi. They are our babies and we love them very much.
                After living in San Diego for 5 years, we moved to Boston to stay closer to Juan's family. In 2015,
                we bought a house in Stoneham, MA. We are still in the process of buying furniture and settling in.
                It’s so exciting! Follow me on <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/tackleclutter">social media</a> and
                you will
                see many projects and changes we have been making to our new house as we make it our
                home.</p>

            <p>I've worked with many different clients and types of homes, big and small.
                One of my goals as a professional
                organizer is to show you that you don’t need to have a big fancy
                house to have an organized home. It’s important to be realistic when creating an organization plan.
                Be aware of the space you have, and
                how much you are trying to fit in it. Decluttering first is a must if you want to create an
                organized space. </p>
